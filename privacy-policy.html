        <p><b>Do we use 'cookies'?</b></p>

        <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive
          through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize
          your browser and capture and remember certain information. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate
          data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better
          site experiences and tools in the future.</p>

          information on our behalf.</p>

        <p><b>Third-party disclosure</b></p>

        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information. We
          may also release information when it's release is
          appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or
          safety.</p>

        <p>However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing,
          advertising, or other uses.</p>

        <p><b>Third-party links</b></p>

        <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website
          (e.g. Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics, New Relic, etc.).
          These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or

          of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>

        <p><b>Google</b></p>

        <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place
          to provide a positive experience for users. https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</p>

        <p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website/services.</p>

        <p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie
          enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the Internet.
          Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy.
        </p>

        <p>We have implemented the following: 1) Google Display Network
          Impression Reporting 2) Demographics and Interests Reporting 3) DoubleClick Platform Integration</p>

        <p>We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics
          cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to
          compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to
          our website.</p>

        <p><b>California Online Privacy Protection Act</b></p>

        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
          privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the
          United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable
          Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
          information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:
          http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

        <p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy
          policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page
          after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the
          page specified above.</p>

        <p>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals? We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies,
          or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

        <p><b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b></p>

        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the
          Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United
          States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and
          online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

        <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

        <p><b>Fair Information Practices</b></p>

        <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
          concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
          globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical
          to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

        <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a
          data breach occur: We will notify the users via in-site notification &bull; Within 7 business days</p>

        <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally
          pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
          requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have
          recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
        </p>
